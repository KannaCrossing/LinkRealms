# LinkRealms

LinkRealms was an UltimaOnline inspired indie MMORPGthat first released in 2016 by Mythyn Interactive using their own custom engine. Originally it required a single purchase, but it went free to play prior to it's shutdown in 2018.
It was originally only for sale on their site during testing phases, but was later released on steam. The store page is no longer up, but the community area is still live. [steamcommunity.com/app/402450/](https://steamcommunity.com/app/402450/)

With the help of Batashock from the community [discord](https://discord.com/invite/CtTnqyFGyS) we were able to get in contact with the original developers for linkrealms.
Thanks to that, we have been informed that access to the full source code to both the client and server for link realms may be provided to the community if there is enough demand for it.

At the present moment we are small, but we hope to gather more attention to bring back this once loved game.

For live updates, [discord](https://discord.com/invite/CtTnqyFGyS) is best, however we also have a [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/linkrealms.bsky.social) account.
